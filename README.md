Welcome! This is a crystals collector game where you must reach a certain amount of points exactly, while avoiding the negative crystals (although they can be useful in certain ways). Going above the number or going below 0 will cause you to lose, while reaching the number gives you a win! Let me explain how this game works:

Step 1: Choose a crystal. Now this step is VERY important, because choosing the wrong crystal can end the game!

Step 2: Continue choosing crystals until you reach the number you are looking for. 

Step 3a: If you reach the correct number, you win!

Step 3b: If you go over the number, you lose!

Hint: It would be a good idea if you remember exactly how many points does each crystal give or take away. There will ALWAYS be at least 1 crystal that takes points away.

And that's it! Enjoy!
